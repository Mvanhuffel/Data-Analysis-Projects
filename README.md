# Data Analysis Projects

## Aerofit Customer Profile
The project focused on developing customer profiles for AeroFit's treadmill products (KP281, KP481, KP781) using their customer data. The primary goal was to aid in market research and enhance product recommendations. This involved descriptive analytics, constructing contingency tables, and calculating probabilities to understand customer preferences and behaviors.
