## [Aerofit Customer Profile](https://github.com/Mvanhuffel/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Aerofit%20Customer%20Profile)
This project demonstrated Python's analytical capabilities in a hypothetical scenario for a treadmill company, Aerofit. I analyzed customer and sales data related to Aerofit's product line to assist the market research team. The goal was to identify target audiences and enhance product recommendations. To achieve this, I created distinct profiles for buyers of different treadmill models. This involved using descriptive analytics, constructing two-way contingency tables, and calculating both conditional and marginal probabilities. These methods helped in effectively segmenting the customer base and tailoring product suggestions accordingly.
