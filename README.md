## [Aerofit Customer Profile](https://github.com/Mvanhuffel/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Aerofit%20Customer%20Profile)
This project was an exercise to illustrate Python's analytical capabilities. The dataset came from a treadmill company called Aerofit and contained customer and sales data related to their product line. The aim was to hypothetically aid the market research team in identifying target audiences and enhancing product recommendations by creating distinct profiles for buyers of different treadmill models offered by the company. This was done by utilizing descriptive analytics to analyze customer data, construct two-way contingency tables, and compute conditional and marginal probabilities.
