# Data Analysis Projects

## [Aerofit Customer Profile](https://github.com/Mvanhuffel/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Aerofit%20Customer%20Profile)
This project was an exercise to illustrate Python's analytical capabilities. The dataset came from a treadmill company called Aerofit and contained customer and sales data related to their product line. The aim was to hypothetically aid the market research team in identifying target audiences and enhancing product recommendations by creating distinct profiles for buyers of different treadmill models offered by the company. This was done by utilizing descriptive analytics to analyze customer data, construct two-way contingency tables, and compute conditional and marginal probabilities.

## [Schema Auditing System](https://github.com/Mvanhuffel/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Schema%20Auditing%20System)
The primary objective of this system is to systematically log each schema alteration, capturing details such as the timestamp and other pertinent information in a dedicated table. This setup is designed to facilitate two key functions. Firstly, it aims to generate timely alerts or reports about these schema changes. Secondly, it serves as a comprehensive historical record of all schema modifications. This historical aspect is particularly valuable for maintaining schema contract documentation efficiently and accurately, especially in environments where schema changes occur frequently. The overarching goal is to streamline the process of managing schema contracts by providing a clear and accessible record of all changes.
